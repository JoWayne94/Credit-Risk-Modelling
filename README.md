# Credit-Risk-Modelling
This is an introductory project to credit risk during the author's internship at Maxis Communications. Due to cost considerations, the AI & Advanced Analytics team attempts to build an efficient tool for the Consumer Business department in order to easily and accurately assess the default risk of clients if offered a contract. Precisely, the main purpose of the project is to predict the creditworthiness of consumers by scoring them, thus it is a multi-classification problem. Unfortunately, Maxis client datasets are confidential thus cannot be made public. Hence a dataset from Kaggle is used, and can be found through this link:

The dataset consists of roughly 30,000 consumers characterized by 25 variables. The models implemented present an average predictive power (mean AUC around 0.717), but of course they were not final. They are obtained by using logistic regression, random forest and neural network techniques. 

An individual report containing all technical details is included.

Both scripts are written in Jupyter Notebook.
